# Canine

Canine is a simple series of webpages used to demonstrate the howling success of the Hound testing tool.

## Dependencies

Add Hound as a dependency in `mix.exs`:

```
{:hound, "~> 1.0", only: :test}
```

## Go get 'em!

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
